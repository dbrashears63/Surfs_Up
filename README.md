# SURFS UP 

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze weather data to determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop is viable for an all-year-round business in Oahu Hawaii. To establish if this is a year-round business. The report will look at what is considered the warmest month of the year and the coldest month of the year. In this case it is June and December. 

## Resources
Python 3.10, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, hawaii.sqlite, jupyter notebook

## Results
For the month of June, the average temperature is approximately 75 degrees. With a high of 85 degrees. Seventy five percent of the time the average temperature is 77 degrees.

## Summary
After a review of the data the temperature differences between the average and high temperatures for June and December show very little difference. While the minimum temperature does dip below 60 degrees for the month of December, that temperature would not deter avid surfers or ice cream lovers from indulging. 
Overall, from the temperature results this would appear to be a viable year-round business. In addition, more research such as what is the correlation of the amount of tourism that is in Oahu and how do the number look when comparing it the temperature data for the months of June and December.
